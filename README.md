# Front End Mentor Challenge

### Bento Grid Challenge 
***
Hello People this is a solution to a challenge from [FrontEndMentor](www.frontendmentor.io). 
Because this challenge is relatively easy ; I decided to spice it up a little bit and make extra things such as :

 - [ ] No Images are allowed , everything on the page is made manually
 - [ ] Extra animations will be applied (e.g. hover , counter , floating )
 - [ ] No frameworks , only pure HTML , CSS , JS
 - [ ] Dark Mode & Light Mode switching
 - [ ] Shuffling grid items randomly (rearrange cards)
 - [ ] Web Toasts Notifications
